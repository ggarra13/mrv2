Donationware prices of binary licenses through PayPal:

[![Donate](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=UJMHRRKYCPXYW)

I use the email information to contact you privately.  I don't sell your information, as I don't have access to it, except for your email, which I use to contact you.

- u\$  50 for a node-lock license for one year.
- u\$ 150 for a node-lock license to own.

- The prices are cumulative.  If you donate, say u\$ 10 in 5 months, you can access the node-lock license for one year.

License works for both mrv2 and vmrv2 (you can have both installed).

Demo Versions
-------------

The OpenGL releases at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/mrv2/files/beta/opengl

The Vulkan releases at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/mrv2/files/beta/vulkan

directory are versions for you to evaluate mrv2 or vmrv2 before a donation and report bugs or performance issues.
Currently, when run as demo these versions don't have:

	   - Annotations
	   - A/B Comparisons
	   - OpenEXR Layer switching
	   - NDI support
	   - Allow more than 5 minutes of use.

Notes about Vulkan on Windows
-----------------------------

In order to get HDR, you currently need to have Windows 10+ (11 is ideal) and
an HDR monitor.

Notes about Vulkan on NVidia Linux
----------------------------------

In order to get HDR, you currently need to have the KWin6 or GNOME48 compositors and an HDR monitor.

It will likely work with any NVidia RTX 3080+ or similar AMD board, but it will require you to choose and test your hardware carefully.

The preferred NVidia driver tested for best performance is nvidia-driver-570 (default on Ubuntu 25.04 with GNOME48).

Notes about Vulkan on macOS Intel
---------------------------------

- Only up to Vulkan 1.3 is currently supported.
- HDR on macOS needs a MacBook Pro.
  MacBook Pro Intel will give you up to 1000 Nits of HDR depending on model.
- MacBook Pro Silicon should work with any M1 device up to HDR+.

cat <<EOF > INSTALLATION_NOTES.md

## Notes on installation

- On macOS you install it by opening the .dmg file, and dragging the ${mrv2_NAME}
  icon to the Applications directory.  If there's already a ${mrv2_NAME} version,
  we recommend you overwrite it.
  The macOS application is currently not notarized, so when you launch it you
  will not be able to run it as macOS will warn you that the file is not secure
  as it was downloaded from internet.
  To avoid that, you need to open the Apple Logo->Settings->Privacy and Security
  and go to Security and allow "Opening Anyway".
  Alternatively, you can do it from the Terminal, by:
  
\`\`\`
  sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/${mrv2_NAME}.app/
\`\`\`

- Windows and Chrome, like macOS, also protect you from installing files
  from the Internet.  When you first download it with Chrome it may warn
  you that it is not an usual archive to be downloaded.  Make sure to click
  on the right up arrow menu to Save it anyway.
  You cannot open the .exe from Chrome directly.  You will need to open
  Windows Explorer and go to the Downloads directory.  You should then
  run it from there.
  Then Windows will popup a Blue box telling you Windows SmartScreen
  prevented the start of an unknown application and that you can place your
  PC at risk.
  Click on the More Information text and a Button that says Run anyway or
  similar should appear.  Click on it and follow the standard instructions
  to any Windows installer.
  One note about the Windows install.  When asked if you want to add ${mrv2_NAME} to
  your PATH, it is recommended to answer No to it, as it avoids DLLs conflicts
  with other applications that use common libraries like FFmpeg or OpenUSD.


- On Linux, in order to install the .rpm or .deb packages requires your user to
  have sudo permissions.

  On Debian (Ubuntu, etc) systems, you would install with:

\`\`\`
  sudo dpkg -i ${mrv2_NAME}-${branch}-Linux-amd64.deb
\`\`\`

  On Fedora, you would install it with:
  
\`\`\`
  sudo rpm -i ${mrv2_NAME}-${branch}-Linux-amd64.rpm
\`\`\`

  Once you install it, you can run mrv2 by just typing ${mrv2_NAME} in the shell, as
  a symlink to the executable is placed in /usr/bin.  The installers will also
  associate file extensions and install an icon for easy starting up in the
  Desktop icon of the user that installed it.  For running ${mrv2_NAME} with the icon,
  you need to select it and use the right mouse button to open the menu and
  choose Allow Launch.
  
  If you lack sudo permissions in your organization, you should download the
  .tar.gz file and you can uncompress it with:
  
\`\`\`
  tar -xf ${mrv2_NAME}-${branch}-Linux-amd64.tar.gz
\`\`\`

  That will create a folder in the directory you uncompress it from.  You can
  then run ${mrv2_NAME} by using the mrv2.sh shell script in the bin/ subdirectory.
