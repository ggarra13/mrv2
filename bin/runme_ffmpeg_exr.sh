# Small build script for mrv2.  Run it from the root of the mrv2 dir, like:
#
# ./bin/runme_small.sh
#
# It builds all dependencies and will install
# the main executable on BUILD_DIR (by default
#                                   BUILD-OS-ARCH/BUILD_TYPE/install/bin).
#
# The small build does not have Python, USD, PDF, NDI or NETWORK support.
# It is intended for solo artists.
# 
#
# On Linux and macOS, it will also create a mrv2 or mrv2-dbg symbolic link
# in $HOME/bin if the directory exists.
#
# It will also log the compilation on $BUILD_DIR/compile.log
#


#
# Store the parameters for passing them later
