- Same for Vulkan's hdr utility.
- Flattened tlRender from a submodule to a directory to start working on porting
it to Vulkan.
- Added mrvCore/mrvBackend.h to select which backend should mrv2 use.  By default, we still use opengl.

v1.3.7
======

- Fixed Ghost Previous and Ghost Next not being in sync on the Secondary viewport.
- Made stepping with Next Annotation and Previous Annotation loop once they reach the final and first annotation respectively.
- Fixed opening Secondary Window not displaying the video when the video was stopped.
- Fixed Render->Minify Filter and Render->Magnify Filter toggling from the menu entries (Shift + F was working fine).
- Fixed Render->Minify and Magnify filter toggling.
- Fixed Render->Minify and Magnify saving in preferences.
- Added full support for Japanese language in the UI.
- Fixed some warnings when starting mrv2 with PYTHONHOME set on Linux.
- Removed the "export FLTK_BACKEND=x11" line as Wayland now is mature enough.
- Fixed tonemapping not turning off when switching from an HDR movie to aces SDR one.
- Fixed playing movies that have frames of 0 duration.
- Added Preferences->Render->HDR to control chromaticities and tonemapping.
- Fixed tags not getting saved when using save image or save movie.
- Made OpenEXRs keep the Data Window and Display Window when saving.
- Fixed OpenEXR saving when channel count was different than 4.
- Added the option in the Save Image Options for OpenEXR to allow saving the Data Window or flatten the image to save the full Display Window.
- Updated build to work with CMake 4.0.
- Added Playback->Annotation->Toggle Visible to toggle on or off the annotation without deleting them.

- Revamped macOS install to support installing multiple applications.
- Updated ZLIB to v1.3.1.
- Made PNG link statically to avoid macOS issues.
- Updated Poco to 1.14.1.
- Added hotkey to toggle OCIO on and off.  By default, it is Alt + p (mnemonic pass through).
- Added hotkey entry for Compare None.  It was already present, but missing from Hotkey listing.  It is not set to any hotkey by default.
- Added a (currently in beta) hdr tool, to show the content of mrv2's viewport in full HDR (High Dynammic Range) by using the NDI Output's Best Format.  The way it works is that you stream your video through mrv2's NDI output and watch it in the hdr tool which works with Vulkan.  It is primarily made to wotk locally, albeit it can also work across the network.  NOTE: it has been tested only on masOS Intel and it is currently not available on macOS arm64.  LIMITATIONS:  it works well for FullHD content albeit 4K content tends to lag and it is mostly useful for single frames.

v1.3.6
======

- Fixed a serious OpenEXR crash on multipart files.
- Dramatically improved NDI input stream playback performance.  If playing with no audio, it is immediate.  If playing with audio, it will play with a 4 seconds delay.
- Fixed a hanging when playing NDI with audio.
- Fixed a zombie process when playing NDI upon program exit.
- Fixed locale (Internationalization) issues on Windows, which would make it impossible to switch to a different language if your Windows was not set up as English.

- Moved building of dav1d, lcms2, vpx and SvtAV1 on Windows to the tlRender repository to avoid dealing with shell scripts.  This makes the build on Windows faster too and consistant on all platforms.
- Ported stack trace in debug and reldeb builds to use cpptrace on Windows and Linux.  The advantage is that it can give us stack traces of threads other than the main one.  Not as good as the traces of macOS, but it is a start.
- Fixed installation of NDI Advanced DLL being with the wrong name.
- Fixed builds when not building Python.
- Made building faster by using NPROCS.

- Fixed problem on Windows making the executable not run.
- Fixed command-line arguments not showing up when the application was used
  from Powershell or cmd.exe.

properly.
- Fixed Window's set_fonts() returning font names longer than 32 characters leading to problems of some users starting the program.

  Float on Top as in X11, macOS or Windows.  This is a limitation of Wayland.
- Fixed pip.sh script to call pip on the local mrv2 install.
- Added information about environment (desktop, os and kernel) of the machine that was used to build it.
- Made Build and Running log information tidier.
- Cleaned up log messages a bit and added a -logLevel flag.

v1.3.0
======

One major new feature and one important bug fix.

- Added tone-mapping of HDR videos.  Note that FFmpeg seems to be buggy when
  reading the frame metadata, so we must rely on the stream metadata only.
  Note that to compile this on Windows, you must install MSVC's shipped clang
  compiler.
  
- Fixed tiling behavior (dragging of timeline bar not making view window
  smaller) which got broken in v1.2.9.
  

v1.2.9
======

- Handle **AV_DISPOSITION_ATTACHED_PIC** properly, instead of skipping it.
- Added PNG decoder so attached png pictures in .wav files are decoded properly.

  from the command-line by just doing something like:
  ```
  mrv2 <INPUT_FILE> -ics ACEScg -od 'sRGB - Display' -pythonScript bakeOCIO.py -pythonArgs <BAKED.mov>
  ```
  Note that this script bakes without annotations support so if saving a float
  EXR to an 8 or 16-bit image, you will get banding.

  next images, without looping.
- Added "Image/Go to/<Clip>" to switch from one clip to the next without having
  to bring up the Files Panel.
- Added "Image/Compare/<Clip>" and "Image/Compare Mode" to compare images 
  without bringing up the Compare Panel.

  timeline from a list of clips (movies or sequences) provided in the 
  command-line.  Note that FPS is taken to be that of the one with highest 
  FPS, so sequences may leave gaps if video clips bigger than their FPS are
  used.
- Made -otio or -edl command-line option work with relative paths.
- Fixed .otio, .otioz and -edl flags when concatenation videos with different
  rotations.

v1.2.1
======

- Fixed codec support (libvpx, dav1d and Svt-Av1) which had gotten broken due
  to new way of building FFmpeg.

  the API changed and the install/include/FL directory was not cleared.


v1.1.7
======

- Made mrv2's custom file requester create thumbnails on demand when they are
  on view.  This helps for large files like many big USD files on disk or with
  RAW files which are also slow to load.

  playback.  I was doing the same on mrViewer, but I had forgotten about it.
- Update tlRender to use OTIO v0.16.0.
- Added what each contributor did so far for the mrv2 project.
  If you don't want to be listed as contributor, not list your email address,
  or something else, please let me know.
- Updated update_mrv2.py script.  Tested on macOS, Windows, Rocky Linux 8.9
  and Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS.  From now on, you can rely on automatic upgrades
  if you go to Window->Preferences->Behavior->Upgrades and set them at Startup.
  When you start mrv2, it will check to see if there is an upgrade after 5 days
  of the actual release (so any portential early bugs are squashed).
- Improved translation CMake scripts.
- Added documentation on how to get Wayland working almost flawlessly on Ubuntu
  22.04.4 LTS.
- Added 120 FPS, which drops frames but it is still nice to quickly browse a
  movie.
- Darby's Rec709 coefficients and YUV shader were incorrect leading to subtle
  color shifts.  Now they are fixed.
- Fixed shifting clips with annotations when transitions were present.
  

v1.1.6
======

This is a release full of goodies and bug fixes.

- **ATTENTION**:
  This version introduces a change in the way Cache Settings are used for
  movie files.
  The Settings->Gigabytes and the pair of "Settings->Read Ahead" and
  "Settings->Read Behind" are now decoupled.
  In the case of sequences, the Read Ahea and Read Behind will be automatically
  calculated from the Gigabytes settings as before.
  However, for movie files the timeline will only display the settings for
  Read Ahead/Behind, not the actual Gigabytes cache (which can be bigger than
  the read ahead/behind setting).  The small Read Ahead and Read Behind is to
  allow playing 4K movies backwards.
  The Gigabytes setting of 0 is **NO LONGER USED** and will revert to
  4 Gb if set to 0.

- Fixed slow seeking on 4K movies.  Now we beat OpenRV on **all** movies,
  seeking and reverse playback too.
- Improved performance of dragging Tile like the main divider between the
  view and timeline viewport, particularly on macOS.
- Made switching languages keep the UI preferences.
- Fixed cross cursor when entering the view area and coming from the draw
  tools or the drag bar.
- Made drag bar change color besides changing cursor to indicate you can
  drag it.
- Fixed NDI playback with audio which had gotten broken on v1.1.1.
- Improved .githook to run dos2unix to avoid dummy commits due to Windows'
  CR returns.
- Fixed window resizing calculation that had two ugly bugs in it (thanks
  to ManoloFLTK for having dealt with my ugly code!!!).  Now resizing of
  the main window takes the dock properly into account.
- Fixed auto hiding of the pixel bar from the preferences switched is changed
  and okay'ed while the movie is still playing.
- Fixed seeking on the timeline on Linux sometimes getting the event
  incorrectly on X.
- Fixed starting a movie with loop on and playing stopped and then start
  playing it backwards.
- Refactored playback code and fixed playback buttons sometimes getting out of
  sync compared to the command-line flags passed.
- Created Preferences->User Interface/Thumbnails to select the places
  where thumbnails appear.  Currently can be above the Timeline and in the
  Panels.
- Made the thumbnail above the thumbnail a tad smaller and more polished.
- Fixed a potentially nullptr pointer de-referencing when OpenGL accuracy was
  set to Automatic.
- Worked around an UI redraw issue on Wayland.
- Fixed timeline interaction (dragging clips in .otio timeline) in 1.1.5
  re-release.
- Fixed macOS issues when showing and hiding the timeline bar.
- Made View Window / Timeline Viewport divider highlight in a grayish color
  when it can be dragged.
- Made Panel divider highlight in a grayish color when it can be dragged.
- Fixed cursor when dragging on the Panel divider bar.
- Fixed cursor sometimes switching to the Arrow instead of the Cross cursor.
  This was maily a Linux issue.
- Fixed background transparent color being lighter on Wayland.
- Added Cache Use and Cache Percentage to HUD's Cache display.
- Made Edit button turn on/off automatically according to the size of the
  timeline viewport.
- Added default sensible Window settings for UI panels when in window mode.
- Made Window settings for UI panels get saved even if they were in panel mode.
- Fixed .otio markers display in timeline viewport.
- Fixed size of Timeline Viewport when in Edit mode on macOS.  Now it resizes
  properly.

======

This is a critical update for Windows and more importantly Linux users.
It is a bug fix release for the regressions in v1.1.4 which was rushed:

- Added a FAQ on the documentation about Linux XWayland and Wayland on
  why it could make playback slow if your OS was not configured properly.
- This is the first version that supports Wayland and XWayland.
  For instructions on how to set XWayland and Wayland on Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS
  with NVidia drivers, please see Help->Documentation the FAQ section.
- Fixed annotations not showing when Blit Viewports was on.
- Fixed hiding of pixel bar sometimes failing even when:
      Playback->Auto Hide Pixel Bar
  and:
      Playback->Auto Playback was on.

  recent menus or from the command-line.
- Fixed color buffers not taking full advantage of OpenGL improvements on
  Windows mainly.
- Fixed incorrect positioning and resizing of the images on loading
  which would crash Wayland.
- mrv2 can now be built with the pre-installed python, without having to
  build python itself.  Of course, in that case, mrv2 cannot be re-distributed.
- Added a python translating system for plug-ins.
- Translated all update-mrv2.py strings into Spanish.
- If using blit for the viewports, automatically switches to shaders if
  Background is transparent and image has transparency, as glBlitFrameBuffers
  does not support alpha blending.

  paths.
- Install update-mrv2.py always, instead of removing it when python demos
  was not installed.
- Added instructions on Windows on how to retrieve the Explorer thumbnails.
- Darby has been busy!  He added automatic scrolling of the timeline when
  playing and ability to toggle track and clip info.
- Added Darby's new options to Network connections.

v1.1.2
======

- Windows version of mrv2 is now compiled with MSVC 2022.
- Fixed opening directories from within the command-line.
- Fixed stopping of playback when playing and selecting an area with
  Shift + Left Mouse Button drag or panning with Ctrl + Drag.
- Made status bar report "Everything OK." after 10 seconds without further
  errors.

  action with some other button before.
- Fixed a precision problem when shifting annotations at the beginning of a
  clip due to a following clip being dragged to the same place as the
  annotation.
- Improved performance of timeline drawing when annotations are present.
- Fixed refreshing of image sequences
  (ie. Files Panel->Select Image->RMB->File/Refresh Cache) when there were
  missing frames and later they were added.  It used to work in v1.0.0 but a
  change in tlRender broke it.
- Updated mrv2 to Python 3.11 to conform to the VFX 2024 Platform.
- Python 3.11 on Windows is now built with optimizations on.
- Updated mrv2's glfw3 to 3.4.
- Updated mrv2's FLTK build to use the system libdecor
  (needs v0.2.2 at least).


v1.1.1
======

- Added keyboard shortcuts for Render/Video Levels and Render/Alpha Blend.
- Added support for multiple audio tracks.  You can switch from one to the
  other by selecting the Audio button (the speaker icon) with the
  Right Mouse Button and selecting a track.
- Fixed audio metadata in audio section of Media Info Panel for each audio
  stream.
- Added missing video metadata in video section of Media Info Panel.
- Improved speed of refreshing of a clip (when switching audio tracks or using
  View->Ignore Display Window).
- Made movies longer than 30 minutes with multiple audio tracks, use a short
  read ahead / read behind or switching audio would be too slow.
- Fixed saving movies with annotations and with an alpha channel.
- Fixed saving movies with annotations at half or quarter resolution.
- Fixed an ugly bug on Linux when saving movies with annotations repeating
  every other frame (ie. saving on two's).
- Fixed line error reporting in Python's Output (pybind11 bug).
- Added Editor/Jump to Error to Python Panel.  You can select the line of the
  error in the Python output and the Editor will jump to the offending line.
  If you don't select anything in the Python output, it will jump to the last
  error counting from the bottom.
  It will skip errors from files that are <frozen ...>, like importlib.
  If the error is on a file and not from the Python Editor, mrv2 will try to
  open an external editor and jump to the line of it.
  The editor to use is taken from the EDITOR environment variable first.
  If not set, mrv2 will try to use one of the popular editors.  Its defaults
  supports the syntax for emacs, gvim, vim, VS Code, notepad++ and nano.
  The preferred editor is checked at start up based on what you have installed
  on your PATH and whether you are running interactively or also have a
  terminal.
  Visual editors are given preference over terminal editors.
  Of course, you can edit the editor with Python Panel->Editor/External Editor.
- Fixed Python error reporting in the Python Output of the Python Panel for
  mrv2 python plug-ins.
- Fixed message that said it was saving a movie without audio when saving
  a sequence of frames.

  sequence did not start at 0.
- Fixed a minor bug using snprintf of int64_t with an int specifier.
- Improved the main web page for mrv2.
- Fixed translation of "Color" in Panels.  Of course, since English and
  Spanish use the same word, this still makes no difference :D!
- Fixed the name of the video stream in the Media Info Panel to be like the
  layer name listed in the Panels and in the Color Channel pull down.
- Added back truehd decoder and encoder which were removed from
  TLRENDER_FFMPEG_MINIMAL compilations.
- Sped up redrawing when the Media Info Panel was open, as we now refresh
  only the tabs that change.
- Fixed changing the first and last frames from the Media Info Panel.
- Modified int sliders to use HorSlider instead to make it consistant.
- Fixed (very slow) changing speed from the Media Info Panel.
- Fixed HorSlider resizing improperly when values were bigger than 10000 or
  smaller than -10000.
- Improved precision when accepting or editing text with a zoom factor or
  pixels_per_unit different than 1.

- Made Windows installer create a registry entry backup for the file
  associations, instead of using an .ini file which was worse.  On uninstall,
  the original file association is restored or the registry entry is deleted.
- Added a friendlier name to Windows' Open With RMB menu.  Now the version is
  listed, instead of just "mrv2.exe".  Also the name in English is provided.
- Added a latest version to Windows' Open With RMB menu.  If used, it will
  associate the latest version installed with the file.  Upgrading won't
  require you to reset file associations like before.
- Fixed rotations not framing the image even when View->Auto Frame was on.
- Added symbolic links on Windows .exe installer, so that it works more like
  Unix.
  You can use mrv2-v1.1.0.exe to call a specific version of the viewer for
  example.
- Split Timeline into "Timeline" and "Edit" Preferences in Preferences Window.
- Added Default View to "Edit" to select what gets displayed when you hit the

- Added support for saving PNG and TIFF with alpha channel when saving a half
  or float OpenEXR image.  TIFFs will get saved in float.  PNG in 16-bits.
- Eliminated duplicated error and warning messages from the logs.
- Improved start up time and sync issues with NDI streams.
- Simplified all parameters in NDI stream to just selecting the source.
- Allowed NDI streams to change size, pixel aspect or color space.
- You currently cannot mix two NDI streams, one with audio and one without.
  Only the first one information will be used.
- You also cannot stream two clips through NDI with different audio
  frequencies or channels.
- Streaming two clips through the same connection after stopping for a while
  can lead to audio stuttering.  Either stream them one after the other or
  open a new connection.


v1.0.9
======

  on FFmpeg errors.
- Made the panel drag bar a tad more grey, for a nicer look and more clear
  distinction when several panels are stacked on the dockbar.
- Fixed a thumbnail refresh issue on mrv2's custom file requester which would
  show when we save over a previous file.  tlRender would cache the file and

  Sam Richards is the same.
- Fixed a bug in session loading when there was no Input Color Space specified
  in the image, which got introduced in v1.0.8.
- Made pen size be able to be 1 pixel making the cursor one line only.
- Made prores_ks (FFmpeg's native encoder) match Apple's ProRes one at
  4444p10le.  It is now possible to take ProRes4444 encoded files to video
  editors.
- Upgraded to FFmpeg v6.1.1.
- Improved rotation speed of movies from cell phones, by doing it in OpenGL
  with metadata instead of with a C++ function.

  SHIFT + Enter.
- Added FFmpeg's actual version information, not just each library.
- Fixed listing of codecs in the About Window.
- Added missing .gif decoder and encoder.
- Added mrv::TextBrowser to allow copying the text in them with a RMB context
  menu. This is useful, for example, in the About Window for the GPU or codec
  information, as the full lines get copied, unlike a Fl_Text_Display in which
  a line can be cut in half.
- Fixed gcc version information in mrv2's About Window.  It was showing the
  __GLIBCXX__ instead.
- Darby simplified and fixed the A/B comparison sometimes getting out of sync.
- Improved the look of HorSlider widget.  Now the X to reset to defaults is
  a tad to the right.
- Fixed selection of Wipe mode which would not work after scrolling in the
  docker (FLTK bug?).

   -ol (-ocioLook) command-line flags to override the default settings.
   Note that -ocioDisplay and -ocioView must be used together.
 - Made OCIO Input Color Space be stored with the image, except when doing
   comparisons in which the first image's Input Color Space is used.
 - Made OCIO Input Color Space for each image be stored in session files.
 - Made FFmpeg's repeated warnings and errors only show up once in the status
   bar and the logs.

- Metadata in Media Info Panel is now sorted and stripped of repeated data.
- Media Info Panel's tabs now remember whether they were opened and closed.
- Added GoPro Cineform codec to the list of profiles you can use to encode.
  The biggest benefit is that it can encode at GBRP_12LE and GBRAP_12LE (ie.
  RGB and RGBA at 12 bits with alpha) for a replacement to Apple's proprietary
  ProRes4444 codec.
- Removed the GoPro prefix name from Cineform when saving.
- Fixed saving of EXR movies to movie files being just RGBA_U8 instead of
  RGBA_U16.


v1.0.6
======

- Darby fixed Render->Alpha Blend modes which were partially broken.
- Darby fixed macOS checkers drawing.
- Darby added gradient background and moved it to draw video.
- Made Background colors use Flmm's color chooser with alpha (alpha is

  profile being set to 0, which would prevent saving with 10 or 12 bits.
- Fixed Prores color shifting due to bad unneeded use of libswscale API.
- Added options for color_range, colorspace, color_primaries and color_trc in
  tlRender's source code.  mrv2 can set them if you open the window called
  Advanced Settings in the Save Movie dialog.

  h264, vp9 and av1 presets, but you are free to create your own.
- Switched to building with gcc-12 on Rocky Linux 8.9 (not in Dockerfile or
  Github builds).
- Fixed encoding of movie files' YUV conversion.  Now the movie file is much
  more accurate.

  when turned off will turn off the audio playback while scrubbing, like
  on previous versions of mrv2 (v0.8.2 and earlier).
- Added NDI® support in source code.  You need to compile mrv2 against the
  NDI® SDK for now.


v1.0.0

  section of the main UI.  Helps in scrubbing 4K movies.
- Made readBehind cache expand freely when using Gigabytes in Settings
  to improve the performance of scrubbing 4K movies.
- Fixed a crash when showing an .otio timeline with markers at start or when
  dragging a clip with .otio markers.
- Added display of transitions (Dissolves) to Timeline Viewport.  If you edit
  a clip that has transitions, those will be removed before the move.
  Currently, there's no way to add transitions again (you need to edit the
  .otio file manually, or convert it from a Non-Linear Editor format).
- You can also not currently move or scale the transitions.
- Fixed default versioning regex for '_v' to match UNC paths on Windows.
- Fixed version of USD which showed MaterialX version instead.
- Updated USD to v23.11.


v0.9.4
======

v1.0.0 of mrv2 will be released on January 1st, 2024.  Therefore, it is of
utmost importance that you report any bugs you find before that.

- Improved Help/Update mrv2 Python script to work fine at start up on beta
  builds.
- Added the option to Update mrv2 even if you are already using the same
  version.  Useful to upgrade from a beta build to a release build.
- Improved performance of Python Panel by not having it wrap at bounds.  This
  allows faster resizing of the panel on Linux mainly.
- Fixed cursor shape in Python Panel when entering the divider between the
  output and the editor.
- Prevented resizing of the Python Panel to very small sizes when in window
  mode.
- Added $HOME/.local/lib/python${PYTHON_VERSION}/site-packages to the default
  search path of PYTHONPATH in environment.sh.
- Fixed Pixel Bar showing up when set to auto hide pixel bar on playback and
  in presentation mode.
- Made the command-line -p (-playback) switch override the default Auto
  Playback preference setting.
- Switched the default hotkeys of the Pixel Bar (was F2, now F3) and timeline
  (was F3, now F2) to make them consistent to the order on the view window.
  For that new hotkey assignment to take effect, you need to reset the hotkeys
  in Windows->Hotkeys or remove $HOME/.filmaura/mrv2.prefs.
  Note that that means you will loose any custom hotkeys you may have.
- Added support for .ts movies.
- Fixed OCIO support on network connections, changing both the pulldown menus
  as the OCIO color panel, which had gotten broken on the OCIO optimization and
  the OCIO looks addition.
- Added option to File->Save->Frames to Folder.  First, you will be asked
  to save an image and settings as usual.  However, after you save the first
  image, every time you invoke this function, it will save the image with the
  name and frame number without asking for confirmation.
  If you want to reset saving the image name, go to File/Save/Single Frame
  as usual.
- Some minor speed optimizations from Darby Johnston.


v0.9.3
======

v1.0.0 of mrv2 will be released on January 1st, 2024.  Therefore it is of most
importance you report any bugs you find before that.

- Made calculation of Actual Frame Rate more robust by averaging it over
  multiple frames.
- Added OCIO looks to the GUI, to Python API and to OpenGL display.
- Added OCIO to Color Panel, so that it becomes clearer what you have selected.
- Removed deprecated OCIO scene_linear space.
- Corrected popup-menu pulldown changing label even when enable label was
  disabled.
- Fixed OCIO view pull-down menu value being selected from the last display
  instead of the actual selected and used display at start-up.
- Made pixel bar not show up after going to Preferences if video clip is
  playing and Auto Hide Pixel Bar is on.
- Added OCIO Looks loading/saving to mrv2.prefs file.
- Added rotation and flipping for YUV formats to handle movie files taken from
  a phone like an IPhone.
- Removed setting OCIO ICS, View and Look by index as they were not taking into
  account the submenus.
- Solidified OCIO ICS return and set functions to support submenus.
- Made Panels appear in the same order that they were when exiting the
  application, instead of showing alphabetically.
- Documentation is now online at:
  		English: https://mrv2.sourceforge.io/docs/en
		Spanish: https://mrv2.sourceforge.io/docs/es

v0.9.2
======

- Added .otioz to Windows file associations installer and uninstaller.
- Fixed Hotkeys not working.
- Fixed dead hotkeys Shift 1 to 9 and 0.
- Made Hotkey entry work on just pressing a key, without having to type or
  having to select a special key from the awkward Special pull down menu.
- Fixed Meta (Windows) hotkey shortcuts on Linux.
- Added Zoom Minimum and Zoom Maximum to hotkeys, so you can turn them off.
- Caught Escape hotkey on Window callback to prevent it from exiting the
  application if it is not set to do so.
- Increased performance of playback on Linux when the timeline is visible at
  high frame rates (60 FPS).
- Increased performance of playback on Windows when the timeline is visible.
- Actual Frame Rate display in the HUD when FPS is selected (it shows
  Skipped Frames, Actual Frame Rate and Target Frame Rate).
- Made cursor disappear on Presentation mode after three seconds of inactivity.
- Added OpenGL controls for blitting the timeline or using shaders.  Blitting
  the timeline can improve performance on some graphic cards and OS.  In my
  tests Windows and Linux benefit from blitting while macOS benefits from
  using shaders.
- Added OpenGL control for Vsync.  Currently it works on Linux and macOS.
- Fixed default value of Minify / Magnify filters from the preferences to
  be Linear instead of Nearest.
- For programmers using VSCode, added .vscode directory with tasks to:
    * Build All mrv2 Project with all Dependencies (main compile -- runme.sh)
    * Build tlRender, FLTK and mrv2 (runmet.sh)
    * Build mrv2 only (runmeq.sh)


v0.9.1
======

- Fixed In / Out ranges when loading session files for clips that were not
  the one in playback.
- Fixed editing clips that had a timecode in them.
- Fixed an OpenGL issue mainly on Windows which would flip the video on Y when
  dragging it to create a playlist.  It could also lead to a crash.
- If OCIO config cannot be found, like when it is loaded from a session file,
  defaults to previous config.  Previously it could crash mrv2.
- Made internal checks for files that are not found and for replacing paths in
  path mapping deal with empty filenames properly.
- Fixed a random crash on Windows when loading a session file with
  Auto Playback set to on.
- Fixed an OpenGL flipping/flickering when Timeline Viewport was open and the
  user switched media items.
- Fixed Python's setOcioView() and ocioView() just returning the view name.
  Now both the display and view name are returned.
- Added ocioViewList() Python function to list all Displays / Views available.
- Added a setting for Display / View to Preferences->OCIO Defaults.  It will
  get used whenever the application opens or the user access the Preferences,
  overriding the setting set in the OCIO config file.
- Made panning work with CTRL + Left Mouse Button, besides the Middle Mouse
  Button on both the view and timeline viewport.
- Added Preferences->Playback->Single Click Playback to turn off playing by
  clicking on the main viewport, which was very annoying.
- Added Preferences->User Interface->Render->Minify and Magnify Filters.
  Moved Video Levels and Alpha Blend to this new preferences panel.
- Fixed color display (in both pixel bar and area color panel) not updating
  properly when single stepping through a file.
- Corrected handling of wstring characters on command-line and file associations
  on Windows start up.
- Improved Skipped Frame HUD display (SF:) when FPS is set to active so that it
  does not get confused when scrubbing.
- Fixed Skipped Frame HUD display not resetting itself when going to the first
  or last frame of the movie.
- Added Preferences->Playback->Auto Hide Pixel Bar, which when set, hides the
  pixel bar when playback is started.  This is to prevent slow-downs and
  skipped frames of clips at high resolutions.


v0.9.0
======

- Fixed issues with python library dependencies not copying the dependant DSOs
  on Linux.  This would lead to issues with libssl and libcrypto, for example.
- Fixed cmake's function get_runtime_dependencies() and
  get_macos_runtime_dependencies() only working for one element instead of a
  list.
- Created a python plug-in to automatically check the latest released version
  of mrv2 on github, allow to download it and install it, asking for a password
  if sudo permissions are needed.
  The plug-in is installed by default.  In order to have mrv2 automatically
  check for updates on start-up, you must set Preferences->Behavior and select
  Check for Updates at start up.
- Fixed a minor memory leak when saving movies with audio.
- Made Saving Audio only pop up its own file requester window.
- Thanks to the great Darby Johnston, it is now possible to edit the video and
  audio clips of an otio timeline in the timeline viewport.
- Added Preferences->Timeline the options to start in editing mode and start
  with Edit Associated Clips.
- Added the code and callback to edit the annotations when editing the clips.
- Added Edit/Audio Gap/Insert and Edit/Audio Gap/Remove to insert or remove
  audio gaps matching the length of the video clip at the current time.
- Fixed adding a clip without audio to a timeline with audio that ends before
  the video.  Now a gap is added before the new clip.
- Fixed changing of Timeline->Markers or Timeline->Transitions leaving too
  little or too much space.
- mrv2 now supports audio fading of clips.  Previously, only video would
  dissolve and audio would suddenly stop/start.
- Thanks to Darby Johnston, we now support playing back non-streaming movies
  directly from the http:// and https::// protocols.
- Fixed redraw issues under Wayland.
- Fixed muting of audio not working.
- It is now possible to change the font of the menus in:
     Preferences->User Interface->Fonts.
- Fixed Wayland support on modern platforms like Ubuntu 22.04.3.  Under Rocky
  Linux 8.1 builds, running with more modern distros under Wayland you may
  encounter an error about missing "antialising".

  To fix it:
    
```
$ sudo cp /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.xsettings.gschema.xml /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.xsettings.gschema.xml.bad
$ sudo nano /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.xsettings.gschema.xml
       	    (remove lines 19 and 20)
	 <   </schema>
	 <   <schema id="org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.xsettings.deprecated">
$ sudo glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas
```


v0.8.3
======

- Fixed saving of L_U16, LA_U16, RGB_U16 and RGBA_U16 movies which were
  flipped on Y.
- Sorted Panels in the Panel menu alphabetically instead of by shortcut.
- Fixed Alpha Channel saving images on Annotations when movie was RGBA_U16.
- Now you can concatenate .otio clips into the EDL Playlist.  Just drag the
  .otio clip to the Playlist Panel where you have the temporary EDL
  or to the Timeline Viewport while selecting the EDL and it will
  be added to any previous clips in the timeline.
  The .otio clips support in and out points and annotations.  Transitions are
  supported, but you cannot cut a transition in half with the in and out
  points.
- Fixed a crash when trying to load an inexistent clip from the command-line.
- Made dragging of a clip show the dragged clip in cyan in the Files Panel, to
  distinguish it from the selected one.
- Fixed the dragged clip being also selected after an unsuccessful drag when
  there was a clip selected.
- Made Panel shortcut keys in the menu be more separated from the actual name
  of panel.  Small UI improvement.
- Added shortcuts to Environment Map Panel (Ctrl + e) and
  Playlist Panel (Ctrl + p).
- Improved .otio Playlist creation. Now the audio channel is created only when
  needed.
- Fixed creation of .otio Playlist with a sequence that had the audio on disk
  with the same base name.
- Fixed frame stepping when there were in/out points in the timeline.

- Made routine for relative paths return the original path if the path could not
  be translated into a relative path.
- Fixed the annoying macOS bug where the timeline viewport elements would not
  get drawn sometimes.
- Fixed adding a movie with no audio, which created an audio gap of sample
  rate of 1, leading to precision issues.
- Fixed Annotations shifting when moving clips around in the Timeline Viewport
  (feature of v0.9.0 not yet released by Darby).

  ones.
- Added a cmd.getVersion() to get the version of mrv2 from Python.
- Made playback play with audio when changing frame rate (slower or faster).

  media will not revert to the rgba channel if there isn't an equivalent one.
- USD Panel is now interactive.  You can change the parameters and it will
  show the change.  The only parameter not recommended to change (except for
  very simple scenes) is the complexity.
- USD Panel visibility is now saved in the Preferences.
- Refreshing of cache is now done in seconds, without re-loading and
  switching an image as before.
- Creating a timeline in the Playlist Panel is also done in seconds.
- Fixed a crash when creating an empty timeline or a timeline from a clip in

  the same.
- Hotkeys are now compared properly when they are uppercase and shift was not
  used while another hotkey had shift and a the same lowercase letter.
- Some UI fixes and improvements:
    * The Zoom factor in the Pixel Toolbar keeps its value when selecting
      it from the pulldown.
    * All buttons and displays have the same size on both the timeline and
      pixel toolbar.
    * Cursor in all input fields is now red for easier reading.
    * The FPS input widget now displays the FPS with different number of
      digits to fit the value as best it can on the limited width.

- The RAW Reader properly reads all files but two from:
      https://www.rawsamples.ch
- Fixed an OpenGL refresh/redraw issue when going to the Preferences
  Window and returning with new settings.  It could also provoke a crash on
  Windows.
- Made the Log Panel not save its visibility upon program exit.  This prevents
  the Log Panel Window from opening on a new start up of mrv2 as it is usually
  not wanted, but happens once there had been an error in the previous instance.
- Linux uninstall with DEB and RPM has been improved.  Now, instead of just
  removing the symlink of /usr/bin/mrv2, the symlink is changed to point to the
  latest version installed if any.
- You can now open only one instance of the viewer and new images opened will
  be sent to the already opened viewer, instead of opening multiple instances
  of the viewer.  You set the behavior in:
```  
Preferences->User Interface->Single Instance.
```	
- Removed all warnings and errors from the Sphinx documentation generation.

- Windows installer now will remove the file association first before replacing
  it with the one of mrv2.

  FLTK windows with Python and control and access mrv2's windows with it.
- Added Find and Replace to Python Editor in the Python Panel.
- Added Comment and Uncomment region to Python Editor in the Python Panel.
- Made focus selection on the main view window not work upon just entering.
  This solves the issues with losing focus on the Frame, Start Frame and End
  Frame widgets.  It also fixes problems when showing a Python window which
  would otherwise not stay on top.
- Added Save/OTIO EDL Timeline to the menus.
- Allowed Saving OTIO Timelines of single clips and other .otio files.
- Build system changes and fixes:
   	* Renamed runme.sh script to runme_nolog.sh.
   	* Added a new runme.sh script that calls runme_nolog.sh but saves the compile log into BUILD-KERNEL-ARCH/CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE/compile.log.
   	* Updated windows build script to work with MSVC 2022, not just 2019.
   	* The Windows compilation takes advantage of Msys to install the dependencies of libintl, libiconv and gettext.
   	* Made all compile options work when off.  You can customize mrv2 to build it with either all the bells and whistles or pretty barebones.
   	* Added --help flag to runme.sh to list all the possible settings.
   	* All bash commands are run with run_cmd which prints them and times them.
   	* Added optional build support for all the optional TLRENDER_* settings and for the MRV2_* settings.  It is now possible to build a light version of mrv2 or one with all the features.
   	* Fixed a problem with the embedded python (pybind11) locating the system Python installation instead of the local one instead.  This created havok on my Ubuntu 22.04 when there was an upgrade.
   	* Made parsing of -D options like -D TLRENDER_USD=OFF work with or without a space.
	* Got rid of compiling the slow Gettext on macOS, replacing it with
	  a prebuilt dylib.
	* Made the build system automatically release beta versions of the software after each successful compilation.  You can now download the latest beta binaries from:
     
         https://sourceforge.net/projects/mrv2/files/beta/

- Made right mouse button text size match that of the main menu bar.
- Fixed Preferences->Playback->FPS not doing anything.  Removed
  Preferences->Playback->Override FPS.
- Added a way to edit baked Text Annotations from a frame.
  If you click with the Right Mouse Button on the Text tool, a pop up Window
  will appear displaying a pull down with all your text shapes for the
  current frame.  Selecting one, and clicking on Edit Text will take you to
  the Text widget where you will be able to reposition it, re-edit it, etc.
  This also works in network connections.
- Made text widget font size be dependant on the render size of the image.
- Improved scripts in bin/ directory with help messages.
- Moved python scripts in bin/ directory to bin/python.
- Improved runme.sh script to accept a -gpl flag to compile FFmpeg with libx264
  support in GPL mode on all platforms.  The default is still to build a LGPL
  FFmpeg without libx264 saving support as that complies with the BSD license
  of mrv2's source code.

  create an empty track or start a new EDL with one clip from the Files Panel.
- Added an Edit/Frame/Cut, Edit/Frame/Copy, Edit/Frame/Paste and
  Edit/Frame/Insert to cut, copy, paste and insert one frame (video and audio)
  of any media.  Currently, it does not support transitions, that are removed.
  As soon as one of these commands is used, a new EDL is created.
- Added an Edit/Slice to cut a clip in half at the current time location.
- Added an Edit/Remove to remove the clips that intersect the current time
  location.
- Added Drag and Drop functionality to the Files Panel into the Timeline

  as it was suggested using them in production was usually not the hassle.
- Fixed Image Information Panel size when it was saved as a window with the
  tabs open.

  be compiled with a recent Linux version like Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.  The binaries
  we distribute are compiled with a very old version of Wayland.
- Fixed a potential OpenGL redraw issue when drawing both soft and hard lines.
- Made draw cursor be a white/black shape for easier display.
- Fixed RPM package to install to /usr/local/mrv2-v${VERSION]-Linux-64 without library conflicts.  You can now install it just with something like:

```
  $ sudo rpm -i mrv2-v0.7.0-Linux-amd64.rpm
```

- Made Linux .deb and .rpm installers set the mrv2 desktop icon to Allow
  Launching by default.
- Made Linux .deb and .rpm installers set xdg-mime file associations properly

  multiple versions of mrv2.  Besides /usr/bin/mrv2 pointing to the last
  installed version of mrv2, symlinks with the version number in them are
  also creaetd, like:
       /usr/bin/mrv2-v0.7.0
  

v0.6.4
------
- Improved Python plug-in API.  Now plug-ins are defined with a base class,
  and menus with a dict (without tuples) like:

```
      class HelloPlugin(mrv2.plugin.Plugin):
          def hello(self):
              print("Hello from plug-in!")

          def menus(self):
              menus = { "New Menu/Hello" : self.hello }

  Help->Documentation.  The environment variable used to look up plug-ins is:

  	MRV2_PYTHON_PLUGINS

  It is a list of colon (Linux or macOS) or semi-colon (Windows) paths.
  Plug-ins are defined, like:

```
      class Plugin(mrv2.plugin.Plugin):
          def hello(self):
              print("Hello from plug-in!")

          def menus(self):
              menus = { "New Menu/Hello" : self.hello }
              return menus
```
     	

- Added a mrv2_hello.py plug-in for demo purposes.
- Fixed a bug in the log panel appearing compressed on start up when docked.
- Allowed creation of .otio files of a single clip in Playlist Panel.
- Fixed scratched frames showing up on .otio files with gaps in them.

- Added a new Stereo 3D Panel to control the stereo.
   * To use it, you load a clip with left and right views (usually a v2
     multipart openexr).  Then, open the Files Panel and select the clip and
     layer to use.
   * Open the Stereo Panel and select the Input to "Image".  That will clone
     the clip and select the opposite view (ie. right if you selected left).

- Made File/Clone (Right Mouse Button on Files Panel clip) respect the frame
  and playback state of the original clip.
- Added a File/Refresh Cache (Right Mouse Button on Files Panel clip) to
  refresh the cache.  This is useful when viewing a partially rendered
  sequence.
- Made thumbnails in Files, Compare, Stereo 3D and Playlist panels show the
  actual layer (color channel).

- Made session file store and restore the current time.


v0.5.3
------
- Made area selection allow it to select 1 pixel easier by a single click.
  To disable it, you just need to switch to a new action mode (drawing, etc).
- Some users on older macOS versions reported problems with the Privacy
  mechanism of the OS on Documents, Desktop and Download directories.
  The problem is not there if we use the native file chooser.  I've switched
  the default on macOS to use the native file chooser.
- Added a soft brush for annotations on all shapes.  You access it from the
  Annotation panel which can be opened from the menus or by clicking twice on
  any of the draw tools.  The algorithm for smooth brushes is not yet perfect,
  as it can lead to an overlapping triangle on self intersections.
- Allowed splatting a brush stroke if clicking only once.
- Made Pen size in annotations go as low as 2 pixels.  One pixel tends to
  vanish and have issues when panels are open.

- Fixed precision issues on annotation drawings.
- Made annotations respond to R, G, B, A channels changing.
- Removed ngrok documentation as it was incorrect for internet access.
- Fixed resizing of viewport not taking into account the status bar, leading
  to zoom factors of 1/1.04 instead of 1.

v0.5.2
------
- TCP Control Network port number is now saved in the preferences.
- Volume control is now saved in the preferences.
- Mute control is now saved in the preferences.
- Moved TCP volume and mute control to App.
- Fixed a bug in selection of items in Files Panel when two or more images
  had the same path.

  internet using the free ngrok service.  This allows a single mrv2 server and
  a single mrv2 client to connect for free albeit for non-commercial projects.
  For multiple clients or commercial ventures, you need to pay for one of
  ngrok's plans or use another server of your choosing that will allow you to
  open a network port or remote ssh connection.
- Added parsing of hostname to extract tcp:// and :port from it.
- Upped the network protocol version used.  Now it is 2.  You can no longer
  use v0.5.1 with v0.5.2 or else the paths will get garbled.
- Fixed drawing and erasing of shapes getting drawn in different order.
- Annotations now can only be drawn inside the image instead of everywhere in
  the viewport.
- Fixed annotations ghosting not being drawn transparent in some areas and more
  solid in others.
- Made volume slider knob more attractive.
- Hotkey editor now has a close button on Windows.
- Fixed toggling of magnify texture filtering.
- Added hotkey entry for toggling minify texture filtering.
- Added magnify texture filtering to the list of hotkeys as it was missing.
- Added opacity (alpha) to drawing tools.
- Fixed a major memory leak when switching images which would show up mostly
  on Linux.


v0.5.1

  is used does the drawing get reversed.
- Made cursor re-appear if drawing and using the right mouse button menu.
- Fixed saving of annotations in EXR images when they were big. 

v0.5.0
------
- Added networking to mrv2.  You can have a server and one or more clients and
  they will all colaborate with UI, pan and zoom, color transformations,
  playback, audio and annotations.  They can all be set to send or accept any
  item individually, from either the Preferences or the Sync menu.
  The server should contain the media to be reviewed.  Upon a connection by any
  client, the client will attempt to synchronize with the server.
  The sever and client are on a LAN and if both the client and server use the
  same paths to the media, the client will get all of its media loaded
  automatically.
  If they don't have the same paths, each file will be to the list of path
  mappings set in the Preferences.
  Finally, if that fails, the files will be compared on its base name
  and if matched, it will get accepted as the same clip, with a warning.
  If none of this is true, an error will appear, but the connection will
  continue.  However, syncing among multiple clips may show the wrong clip.
- Added Path Mapping to deal with paths being different on each platform, client
  or server.
- Fixed dragging of the timeline outside of the in-out range.  Now it will
  clamp the slider.
- Fixed a subtle bug in translations of Preferences' tree view which could lead
  to the wizard panel not show.
- Fixed a potential crash on log panel opening (when it was already opened).
- Fixed a bug on Windows and macOS that would size the panels beyond the bottom
  of the window.

- Fixed Luminance tooltip flickering on macOS.
- Fixed Media Info Panel not showing up when the dockgroup was created for the
  first time.

  else.
- Fixed loop mode at start not showing the appropiate loop mode.
- Made default loop mode be Loop.
- Updated to newer tlRender (new OpenColorIO 2.1, FFmpeg 6.0, etc).
- Due to changes in OpenColorIO, support for Windows 8.1 is no longer
  provided.
- Fixed Panel/Logs not showing as a toggle menu entry.
- We are also dropping support for 32-bit Windows machines, as it waa
  causing a lot of confusion with users downloading the wrong version
  from sourceforge.net when the amd64 (64-bits) version was not tagged as
  default or that it was called amd (and not Intel :)
- Fixed a random crash when invoking panels from hotkeys.

  if you had Spanish selected, it will revert to English.  You will need to
  change it once again.
- Added reporting of memory use to HUD.
- Added Cache in Gigabytes to Settings Panel.  When this is non-zero the
  Read Ahead and the Read Behind are calculated automatically based on
  the Gigabytes number set here.  It divides it by image size, pixel type,
  fps and number of active movies.  It also takes into account audio, but
  poorly.

  has no audio.
- Added number of Cache Ahead and Behind Video and Audio frames to HUD.
  If Ahead Video cache becomes 0 when playing forwards, playback will stop.
- Fixed Text tool input on Wayland.
- Removed libharfbuzz from the Linux distribution as it was causing trouble
  with some newer Linux distros.
- Added a Render->Black Background option to quickly switch from a gray
  background to a black background on images or movies that have an alpha
  channel.

v0.3.7
------
- Added a half OCIO default to handle OpenEXR half images.
- Added timeRange and inOutRange to timeline module.

       or by file media item.
     * Use libraries from the python standard library, except threads.

     The modules are:
     	 import mrv2
	 from mrv2 import cmd, math, imaging, media, timeline
