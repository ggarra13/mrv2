Licensing
#########

If running the OpenGL (mrv2) or Vulkan version (vmrv2) after v1.4.1, as it is a commercial product, you need to license it for your computer.

When you start mrv2, if there's no license it will popup a license helper with
an ID for your machine.

You need to provide that machine ID to ggarra13@gmail.com with your own email to
validate the purchase.

You will then receive an email with your License key, which will look like:

e6dc7488c3b4319f51d9bde0408f191d84333fc568de264644cee4787719b4d

and an expiration encoded date, like:

5e4244070d594a0d4259

You need to enter that long string into the license field and then click on create.  The mrv2.license.prefs will be created on the current user's directory.
