/**
  This container widget lets you maneuver around a set of widgets much
  larger than your window.  If the child widgets are larger than the size
  of this object then scrollbars will appear so that you can scroll over
  to them:
  \image html Flu_Scroll.png
  \image latex  Flu_Scroll.png "Flu_Scroll" width=4cm

  If all of the child widgets are packed together into a solid
  rectangle then you want to set box() to FL_NO_BOX or
  one of the _FRAME types. This will result in the best output.
  However, if the child widgets are a sparse arrangement you must
  set box() to a real _BOX type. This can result in some
  blinking during redrawing, but that can be solved by using a
  Fl_Double_Window.

  The Flu_Scroll widget calculates the bounding box of all its children
  by using their widget positions and sizes (x, y, w, h). Outside labels
  are not considered. If you need outside labels of any widgets or free
  space outside of this bounding box you can add a tiny invisible Fl_Box
  at the relevant corner(s) of the Flu_Scroll widget, for instance:
  \code
    Flu_Scroll scroll(100, 100, 200, 200); // Flu_Scroll at (100, 100)
    Fl_Box(100, 100, 1, 1);               // Fl_Box in top left corner
    Fl_Input(150, 120, 60, 30, "Input:"); // left most widget with label
    // ... more widgets ...
    scroll.end();
  \endcode

  By default you can scroll in both directions, and the scrollbars
  disappear if the data will fit in the area of the scroll.

  Use Flu_Scroll::type() to change this as follows :

  - 0                            - No scrollbars
  - Flu_Scroll::HORIZONTAL        - Only a horizontal scrollbar.
  - Flu_Scroll::VERTICAL          - Only a vertical scrollbar.
  - Flu_Scroll::BOTH              - The default is both scrollbars.
  - Flu_Scroll::HORIZONTAL_ALWAYS - Horizontal scrollbar always on, vertical
  always off.
  - Flu_Scroll::VERTICAL_ALWAYS   - Vertical scrollbar always on, horizontal
  always off.
  - Flu_Scroll::BOTH_ALWAYS       - Both always on.

  Use <B> scrollbar.align(int) ( see void Fl_Widget::align(Fl_Align) ) :</B>
  to change what side the scrollbars are drawn on.

  If the FL_ALIGN_LEFT bit is on, the vertical scrollbar is on the left.
  If the FL_ALIGN_TOP bit is on, the horizontal scrollbar is on
  the top. Note that only the alignment flags in scrollbar are
  considered. The flags in hscrollbar however are ignored.

  This widget can also be used to pan around a single child widget
  "canvas".  This child widget should be of your own class, with a
  draw() method that draws the contents.  The scrolling is done by
  changing the x() and y() of the widget, so this child
  must use the x() and y() to position its drawing.
  To speed up drawing it should test fl_not_clipped(int x,int y,int w,int h)
  to find out if a particular area of the widget must be drawn.

  Another very useful child is a single Fl_Pack, which is itself a group
  that packs its children together and changes size to surround them.
  Filling the Fl_Pack with Fl_Tabs groups (and then putting
  normal widgets inside those) gives you a very powerful scrolling list
  of individually-openable panels.

  Fluid lets you create these, but you can only lay out objects that
  fit inside the Flu_Scroll without scrolling.  Be sure to leave
  space for the scrollbars, as Fluid won't show these either.

  <I>You cannot use Fl_Window as a child of this since the
  clipping is not conveyed to it when drawn, and it will draw over the
  scrollbars and neighboring objects.</I>
