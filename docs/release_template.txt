mrv2 v1.4.5
=======

mrv2 and vmrv2 are open source professional players and review tools for VFX, animation and computer graphics for Windows, Linux and macOS.

It ships now in two compiled versions:
   - mrv2 with OpenGL backend  (free up to version 1.4.0 - donationware afterwards)
   - vmrv2 with Vulkan backend (donationware)

Many improvements to Linux users!
Fixed Vulkan Desktop Scaling support on Linux Wayland.
Fixed Licensing issues using wmic which is missing on newer Windows distros.
Fixed Vulkan slowdown on Wayland when mouse entered the title bar.
Fixed OpenEXR's tile reading code and improved its performance.
Fixed Linux Wayland crash when tooltip was shown and the cursor entered it.
