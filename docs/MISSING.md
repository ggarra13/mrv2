mrv2 is still missing:

- Scrubbing with Audio.
- Playback of 5:1 and 7:1 audio.
- Multiple audio tracks.
- Subtitles (both embedded and coming from an .srt file).
- Stereo Viewing.
- Translations of the UI to different languages.
- RED3D and Blackmagic RAW support.

There are other features that have been deprecated and will *NOT* come back:
