HDR
###

mrv2's OpenGL supports HDR internally but currently cannot display it on an HDR monitor or TV set, as it is a limitation of OpenGL.

mrv2's in its Vulkan backend supports HDR properly if an HDR monitor is provided and, on Linux, if you use a modern Wayland compositor like GNOME 48 or later.

What can also be done is to use an output SDK + output device connected to an external monitor or use NDI® Tools if using NDI®.


NDI®

NDI® uses your local LAN to transmit the video through and can be used for reviewing content among artists.  

If you want to view NDI® with full HDR on a computer monitor, you can use the bundled 'hdr' utility (all platforms) or NDI Tools (macOS or Windows only), which can be downloaded from:
