v1.5.3
======
mrv2 and vmrv2 are open source professional players and review tools for VFX, animation and computer graphics for Windows, Linux and macOS.  You can choose to compile from source or get binaries.

If you are unsure what binary to choose, go to:

https://mrv2.sourceforge.io/downloads/mrv2-download-page.html

mrv2 ships now in two compiled versions:

   - mrv2 with OpenGL backend  (free and donationware)   
   - vmrv2 with Vulkan backend (free and donationware)

It also ships for many more architectures, so be careful to download the correct one.
It has NOT been tested on Windows aarch64 nor Linux aarch64 (beta testers wanted).

They do have, however:

    - Tone-mapping (OpenGL) and HDR (Vulkan)

    - Saving Images and Movies with Audio

Prices might change (go up or down) depending on competition and new features.

ChangeLog
---------

- Improved the look of Text Annotation Widget on Vulkan backend.
- Major refactoring to improve compilation performance.
- Removed Render->HDR->Tonemapping menu from Vulkan backend as it was confusing, since Vulkan does not support tone mapping.
- Upgraded to LibRaw v0.22.0
- Documented mrv2.colors file.  You can create one in $HOME/.filmaura to take over the defaults.
- Changed HUD font for better readability.
- Fixed a resizing bug on Windows when using two monitors with different scaling factors.
- Added support for Pixar's Renderman .z or .zfile shadow map files.
- Fixed the OpenGL bug in macOS mrv2.  There's no longer any need to change your System Settings.
- Switch to A Compare Mode if only a single file is left open.
- Python command to getVoiceAnnotationsJSON now returns the projection matrix.
