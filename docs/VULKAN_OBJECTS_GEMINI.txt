Okay, let's break down Vulkan objects based on their typical scope and lifetime within an application. It's important to remember that these categories are common practices and design patterns, not strict API rules. An application could manage objects differently, but this reflects typical usage.

1. Global Objects

These are objects typically created once during application initialization and destroyed only during application shutdown. They represent the fundamental Vulkan context and the chosen hardware.

VkInstance: The very first object created. It represents the connection between your application and the Vulkan runtime library. It's needed to enumerate physical devices and create surfaces. There's usually only one per application.   

VkDebugUtilsMessengerEXT / VkDebugReportCallbackEXT (Optional but Recommended): Handles debug messages from the validation layers or drivers. Usually created right after the VkInstance and destroyed just before it.   

VkPhysicalDevice: Represents a physical piece of hardware (like a specific GPU) capable of supporting Vulkan. You typically enumerate these after creating the instance and select one (or sometimes more) to use for the application's lifetime. You don't "create" it directly, but rather get a handle to an existing one.   

VkDevice: Represents a logical connection to a VkPhysicalDevice. This is the primary interface you'll use to create almost all other Vulkan objects (queues, command pools, buffers, images, pipelines, etc.). Usually, you create one VkDevice per VkPhysicalDevice you intend to use.

VkQueue: Handles for submitting command buffers to the GPU. You retrieve queue handles from a VkDevice during its creation. While the handle itself is persistent, submitting commands to queues shared across threads requires external synchronization.   

VkPipelineCache: (Optional) Used to store and retrieve pipeline state, potentially speeding up pipeline creation across application runs. Can be global.   

VkDescriptorSetLayout: Defines the template or layout for a descriptor set (i.e., what types of resources are bound to which binding points). These are usually defined once during setup based on shader requirements.   

VkPipelineLayout: Defines the descriptor set layouts and push constant ranges used by a pipeline. Created based on VkDescriptorSetLayouts and typically persists alongside the pipelines that use it.   

VkRenderPass: Defines the structure of a rendering operation: attachments (like color buffers, depth buffers), subpasses, and dependencies between subpasses. Often created once for a specific rendering technique.   

VkPipeline: Represents the compiled state of the graphics or compute pipeline (shaders, vertex input, rasterization state, etc.). Pipeline creation can be computationally expensive, so they are typically created during loading/initialization and reused extensively.

Long-lived Resources (VkBuffer, VkImage, VkSampler, VkImageView): Buffers for static vertex/index data, textures loaded at startup, samplers with fixed configurations, and views for these long-lived images often persist globally.

Memory Allocator Context (e.g., VMA's VmaAllocator): If using a dedicated memory allocation library like Vulkan Memory Allocator (VMA), the main allocator object is usually created globally alongside the VkInstance and VkDevice.

2. Per-Thread Objects
=====================

These objects are often managed on a per-thread basis, primarily to improve performance by reducing contention and simplifying synchronization, especially for command generation.

VkCommandPool: The most common example. Command pools allocate memory for command buffers. Allocating and resetting command buffers within a pool requires synchronization. By giving each thread that records commands its own pool, you avoid the need for locking during command buffer allocation and recording within that thread. Resetting the pool can be done efficiently at the start of each frame for that thread.

VkCommandBuffer (Primary): While command buffers can be short-lived (see local objects), applications often pre-allocate a set of primary command buffers per-thread (and potentially per-frame-in-flight) from the per-thread command pool for reuse.

VkDescriptorPool (Potentially): Depending on the descriptor management strategy, each thread might have its own descriptor pool for allocating descriptor sets used for dynamic or frame-specific data, simplifying allocation and cleanup.   

3. Per-Window Objects (or Per-Swapchain Objects)
================================================

These objects are tied directly to the lifecycle of a specific window surface and the swapchain used to present images to it. They often need to be recreated when the window resizes or surface properties change.

VkSurfaceKHR: An abstraction representing a native window surface that Vulkan can render to. Created from the VkInstance and platform-specific window handles. Tied directly to one window.   

VkSwapchainKHR: A queue of images used for presentation to a VkSurfaceKHR. Created from the VkDevice. It needs to be recreated if the window resizes or surface capabilities change (e.g., format, presentation mode).

VkImage (Swapchain Images): The actual images belonging to the swapchain. You don't create these directly but retrieve handles to them from an existing VkSwapchainKHR. Their lifetime is tied to the swapchain.   

VkImageView (Swapchain Image Views): Views created for each swapchain VkImage, allowing them to be used as render targets or sampled from. Recreated alongside the swapchain.

VkFramebuffer: Binds specific VkImageViews (including a swapchain image view and potentially depth/stencil views) to a compatible VkRenderPass. Since they reference swapchain image views, they need to be recreated when the swapchain (and its views) are recreated.

Resources tied to Framebuffer Size (VkImage, VkImageView): Objects like depth/stencil buffers or intermediate color attachments often have dimensions matching the swapchain. If the swapchain resizes, these dependent resources and their views usually need to be recreated as well.

4. Local (Throw-Away) Objects
=============================

These objects typically have a very short lifespan, often existing only within a single frame or even just for a specific task within a frame. They are created, used, and then destroyed or reset quickly.

VkCommandBuffer (Secondary or frequently reset Primary): Command buffers used for specific tasks within a frame (e.g., one per object draw, or one for UI) are often allocated, recorded, submitted, and then reset or freed very frequently (potentially every frame).   

VkFence: Used to signal from the GPU back to the CPU, typically indicating that a submitted command buffer has finished execution. Often used once per frame submission and then reset for the next frame.   

VkSemaphore: Used for synchronization between queue operations (e.g., ensuring an image is acquired from the swapchain before rendering starts, or rendering is finished before presentation starts). Often signaled and waited upon within a single frame's workflow, then reused.   

VkDescriptorSet: While layouts are global, the actual sets binding specific resources (VkBuffer, VkImageView, VkSampler) might be updated frequently (per-frame, per-material, or even per-draw) if they contain dynamic data (e.g., transformation matrices). They might be allocated from a pool and reset/reused, or allocated ephemerally.

Staging Buffers (VkBuffer): Temporary buffers on host-visible memory used to upload data to device-local buffers (VkBuffer or VkImage). They exist only for the duration of the transfer operation.

Query Objects (VkQueryPool): Used to retrieve information from the GPU like timestamps or pipeline statistics. Queries are typically begun and ended within specific command buffers for a frame, and the results read back later.
